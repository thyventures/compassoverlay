  const blogPosts = scanBlogDirectory();
  
  // 2. Create sitemap entries for each post
  const blogSitemapEntries = blogPosts.map(post => createSitemapEntry(post));
  
  // 3. Read existing sitemap
  const existingSitemap = fs.readFileSync('sitemap.xml', 'utf8');
  
  // 4. Merge entries
  const updatedSitemap = mergeSitemapEntries(existingSitemap, blogSitemapEntries);
