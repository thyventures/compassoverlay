## BTO Projects (February 2025 Launch)

These blog posts will focus on helping potential homeowners choose the best units in recent BTO launches, with a specific emphasis on avoiding the afternoon sun for comfort and energy efficiency.

For each of these blogs, follow the same styles as blog/why-avoid-afternoon-sun-in-singapore-hdb-units/index.html. You should also add a link in the post to the above post for readers to learn more on why choosing a unit that avoids afternoon sun is so important.

The title of the post should be Best units for <BTO project name> that avoids the afternoon sun.

In the seo keywords, "best units in <bto project name>", "best energy efficient units in <bto project name>", "coolest units in <bto project name>" Also include the project launch date in the key word eg "BTO feb 2025"

For each post, start with some overview of the project, like it was introduced in <month of launch by hdb>. Then establish why avoiding afternoon sun is so importat, You can reference the content in blog/why-avoid-afternoon-sun-in-singapore-hdb-units/index.html for this and link to that post to learn more.

Next have a section that talks about the available room types for the project. For you, just list 4 room and i'll manually edit later. Add a space for me to insert the project site map. In the site map image, I would circle the best units of each room type. Then ask users to read along on why each of these units are the best.

Then we will create a section for each room type. But for you, just give me 1 room type(4 room) and I will manually copy for the others since different projects offers different room types. For this section, first 
assign a space for 2 images but you don't need to create the image for me, i'll add it myself. These images will be the top unit of that room type together with the sun direction, one for Dec and one for June which are the months where the sun are at it's extreme angles. Then leave a space for me to explain why this unit is the best unit. You can use this placeholder "This unit is the best unit to avoid afternoon sun since you can see that the sun only directly hits it in June and it hits the service yard which is still ok since you wont spend significant time there especially at night."

Then finally end with the CTA. State that these might be the top units but you might be eyeing other units for other reasons like proximity to the road, privacy, better views for example. If so you can.... Then this is where you copy the pitch from blog/why-avoid-afternoon-sun-in-singapore-hdb-units/index.html the <h2 id="solution">Simple Solutions</h2> section and replicate the exact same content there.

You should create this blog posts in its own directory with an SEO optimized title like "best-units-that-avoids-afternoon-sun-inchencharu-green" for the directory name. In there you will place the index.html. You should also reference the /Users/shaotan/dev/compassoverlay-website/blog/blog-template.html and /Users/shaotan/dev/compassoverlay-website/blog/blog-styles.css for reusable components.
