The file structure now has the header, Google Analytics, Schema.org, CSS styling, main navigation, breadcrumbs, post header with title and meta, project image, introduction to Chencharu Vines as a Standard development featuring 2-room through 5-room units across blocks 964B and 965B, explanation of why avoiding afternoon sun matters, case studies comparing good vs bad units, and the foundation is ready for the unit analysis tabs, expert help sections, FAQ, CTA, social sharing, footer, and JavaScript functionality.
